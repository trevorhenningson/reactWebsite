            <p>
              At OPEX Corporation, I have worked on applying myriad technical
              skills to implement innovative software solutions that drive
              efficiency and accuracy in complex technical environments. In a
              recent project, I led the design of a high-precision barcode
              placement system, creating a custom Python-based GUI using
              Tkinter. This application provided real-time barcode positioning
              feedback during assembly, driving quality control from 5% to 100%
              while cutting installation time by 80%.
              <br />
              To maximize efficiency in data entry work, I developed various
              tools to streamline common tasks. These tools helped to reduce
              completion times by up to 90%. In other projects, I created
              various point cloud data parsing tools with NumPy and Pandas,
              making advanced data analysis accessible to non-technical users
              through intuitive interfaces. In other projects, I analyzed
              performance of various 3D scanning technologies, going so far as
              to develop a custom Python program to test the limits of the Intel
              RealSense camera.

              At Coca Cola, I worked on the Freestyle Engineering team, focused
              on making data-driven improvements to the efficiency and quality
              of the system. While testing fluidics components, I developed
              Python-based programs to extract and compare critical metrics from
              CSV data, enabling precise validation and resolution of
              conflicting hypotheses through quantified results. This analytical
              approach provided clear, data-backed insights that informed
              product development decisions.
              <br />
              Additionally, I modeled pumping mechanism behavior using Python
              (NumPy, SciPy) and MATLAB, simulating flow dynamics to optimize
              performance parameters. These models helped improve flow
              consistency and accuracy, ensuring the components operated at peak
              efficiency under varied conditions.

            <p>
              At Seatrec, I developed a Python-based tool leveraging NumPy and
              Pandas to analyze historical oceanic thermocline data. This tool
              generated a global energy potential heatmap, showcasing the
              capabilities of Seatrec technologies and serving as a valuable
              resource for sales and marketing efforts.
              <br />
              Additionally, I contributed to a grant proposal aimed at securing
              funding for Seatrec technology development. While the proposal was
              not ultimately successful, the experience enhanced my skills in
              technical writing, collaborative problem-solving, and presenting
              data-driven insights to support innovative energy solutions.

            <p>
              With SLB (Schlumberger), I worked within the Shaped Charge
              Manufacturing Facility, a high-volume, automated manufacturing
              facility. Within this manufacturing group, I led projects focused
              on improving reliability, minimizing costs, and increasing yield.
              Leveraging DMAIC root cause analysis, I developed and implemented
              a Python-based dosing algorithm that, when implemented alongside
              mechanical improvements, boosted overall plant throughput by over
              2%.
              <br />
              To help complement manual counting operations, I designed an
              item-tracking system to enhance traceability and validate operator
              counts, improving process accuracy and accountability. These
              efforts showcase my ability to combine data analysis, process
              optimization, and innovative technologies to achieve measurable
              improvements in manufacturing efficiency. My work at SLB also
              helped drive my appreciation for inter-disciplinary engineering
              projects and respect for the outsized impact such projects can
              have on meeting broad company goals.
